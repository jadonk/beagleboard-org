    <body>This project is targeted to Indian Auto mobile market where this solution can  be applied to all ranges of vehicles at a very low cost. Beagle Vehicular box will have following features:-

1. Bluetooth Telephony: Connecting Cell phone with Beagle board requires a Bluetooth usb dongle so that Beagle board can become bluetooth capable. To have bluetooth functionality on Beagle board we need to have Bluetooth drivers and support for this board. These drivers and utilities will be fetched from open source.
Once board is bluetooth capable then:-

1.1. The implementation of transferring call from cell phone to bluetooth needs to be done.
1.2. Implementation of Giving Callers voice on Audio Jack and taking response from external mic needs to be done.
1.3. Lastly transferring the input from external mic to cell phone so that caller can get response.

Enhancement with Touch-screen LCD:

If Touch-screen LCD support becomes available for Beagle board than we can enhance this solution to have a dialling pad on Beagle board. 
By having dialling pad on screen, user can dial a call through Beagle board and once he gets in to his vehicle user do not have to use his cell phone except switching on Cell phone&apos;s Bluetooth.

2. Multimedia Services: Beagle board will  be provided with support of multimedia applications so that user can plug his usb stick and play music through the board. This will require implementation/porting of a open source multimedia player and its supported audio and video codecs.

Enhancement with Touch-screen LCD:
Fellow passenger in the vehicle can watch video which are available in USB stick.

3. Location reporting service: This feature can be used to report vehicle&apos;s current area location. There are two ways to achieve this:-

3.1 User has to connect his GPRS enabled cell phone with beagle board. Beagle board will ask Cell phone about its current location and it will send this location information using GPRS to another server which will keep track of all locations.

3.2. User has to connect USB based internet device to the board.Beagle board will ask Cell phone about its current location and it will send this location information using USB internet to another server which will keep track of all locations.
For this option open source dialler utility for USB based Internet device will be also be required to ported according to Beagle architecture.

Further Enhancements with Touch-Screen LCD:

Web browser can be integrated for surfing.</body>
