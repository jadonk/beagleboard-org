In the past, for job postings and other commercial solicitations around the BeagleBoard I&apos;ve recommended utilizing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1474607&quot;&gt;BeagleBoard LinkedIn group&lt;/a&gt; because I never went deeper than the page that said that the job board was free.&amp;nbsp; As I tried to list my own opening, I found that it was going to cost me almost $200.&amp;nbsp; Given that, I welcome anyone contacting me with information on cheaper ways to do job listings and other commercial solicitations related to BeagleBoard activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I&apos;m inquiring about here is to fill an ARM microprocessor community development team internship position at Texas Instruments for summer 2011.&amp;nbsp; You can find other job opportunities at TI with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hrprod.ext.ti.com/psc/psprodSSS/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_CE.GBL?Action=A&amp;amp;SiteId=2&quot;&gt;TI&apos;s CareerBuilder site&lt;/a&gt; (try keyword &quot;Linux&quot;) or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://careers.ti.com/&quot;&gt;http://careers.ti.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
