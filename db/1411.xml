    <body>The aim of this project is to build a robot that can act as a postman of the internal mail system of offices, universities etc. 

Although we are in the age of electronic mails, there are still some documents that need to be sent as a hard copy. In office buildings, universities, this is handled in an old-fashion way, using a postman, which lacks of speed. A robot can do the same job faster and by carrying more post at a time. It can also connect to the internal Wifi, so that the main queue system will be on a web-page. Users can see where the PostBot is, see the job list, waiting time and assign jobs online via this page.</body>
