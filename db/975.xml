    <body>Why should all the monitors be stationary, and present at one place?
Rather with the miniature sized beagle board we could make the monitors mobile using wifi or other wireless technology supporting realtime video streaming so that multiple boards can receive &amp; display the videos at the same time. Due to its size, the monitors also could be made smaller and integrated with the board &amp; hence pocket sized monitors can be implemented.

Other features that can be added are
* Priority based control.
* Remote control of Doors.
* Transmission of voice to the monitor site from the mobile beagle.
* manual/auto alarm triggering.
* Later, control of all the home appliances &amp; store equipments could be devised using this as an universal remote.</body>
