    <body>The Speech Scrambler is developed on Beagleboard. It involves the development of (at least):

1. Speech Coding (Voice Coder/Encoder)
2. Modulation Techniques
3. Cryptography Algorithm

The modules are leaved to be modular, hence user with their own algorithm can come up easily. 

It uses the analog audio I/O -- by means, this board can virtually act as &quot;plug-in&quot; for any &quot;speech-data&quot;-source which wants to be transmitted by arbitrary transmitter.

For example, we want to transmit speech data using an Amateur Radio, and we want to &quot;make-the-data-secret&quot;. Then we plug the mic into the ScramblerBeagle and put the output of ScramblerBeagle to the transmitter. Then &quot;boom&quot;!, just talk and your data will be transmitted securely. As consequences, the corresponding side who wants to receive the data may also use this board to recover the data.</body>

    <shortdesc>A speech scrambler developed on Beagleboard for scrambling analog audio I/O (in &quot;speech domain&quot;). By scrambling means: processing it digitally using commonly used Cryptography Algorithm (AES, 3DES etc) and or other &quot;unique-your-own-algorithm&quot;</shortdesc>
