 Beagleboards with 512mb of RAM and 600mhz CPUs are powerful enough to be Desktop PCs: they&apos;re also small enough to be portable.  With modular pre-certified cellphone components from Telit such as the GE862, the opencellphone project proved in 2006 that it is possible to create your own mobile phone.  The HBP/D aims to build on the prior success of that project and the success of the Hy Research MID project, to create a powerful and open smartphone project.
 &lt;p&gt;The Telit UC-864-G is the most likely candidate as the radio module, thanks to it supporting Quad-band GSM, Tri-band 3G/HSDPA, and having A-GPS all in the same compact space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The fact that Telit&apos;s documentation is publicly available without requiring an NDA, including full application notes, full hardware and full software disclosure, including the &quot;Digital Voice&quot; Codec AT command-set, makes Telit&apos;s excellent products an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Learning the lessons from HTC smartphone and iPaq PDA reverse-engineering, the Trolltech Greenphone, the OpenMoko, the myPhone, the opencellphone and from a proprietary ARM+GPS+GPRS product, the HBP/D will be an open project from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The initial focus will be to get incoming and outgoing phone calls up-and-running as soon as practical, so that software developers can engage with the project at a very early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
