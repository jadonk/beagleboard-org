    <body>&lt;p&gt;Both ROS and the BeagleBone are great tools and increasingly being used in robotics. Having both of them working together in a easy way would be a great asset. A lot of users show their interest for ARM ROS integration. Some made a couple of tutorials about how to install ROS on Ubuntu on the BeagleBoard however this documentation is getting a bit old fashioned and probably not the right way. There&apos;s also some code to use lightweight versions of ROS but again, roboticists might not be looking for a light-ROS device but a fully functional one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their aim is to provide ROS in an OpenEmbedded Linux system and clearly they ask for coders and people interested which seems a great starting point. My overall goal will be to provide the tools and documentation to set an easy ROS set up. Clarify the limitations and enumerate what&apos;s available and what&apos;s not. Using capes in the BeagleBone is just great and super easy. So why not have them ready for ROS usage as well. This might need a bit of work and i&apos;m excited about diving into it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>
