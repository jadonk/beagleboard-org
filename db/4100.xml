&lt;h2&gt;Where do I find answers to frequently asked questions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org&quot;&gt;beagleboard.org&lt;/a&gt; is the canonical source for information regarding
the Foundation, the eLinux wiki is intended to be the canonical resource for
the community to collaborate on frequently asked questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_FAQ&quot;&gt;http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is BeagleBoard.org and what makes that interesting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BeagleBoard.org is a non-profit corporation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;seeking to improve access to programming and electronics,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;especially through open source collaboration with tools like Linux and Node.JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a collaborative, open source approach, BeagleBoard.org enables
    a broad ecosystem of partners and derived solutions in software, hardware,
    and resources, including books, curriculum, websites and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What people do with BeagleBoard.org designs enables starting quickly and
    eliminating barriers as you move forward. We like to say BeagleBoard.org
    supports you going from &quot;Kindergarten to Kickstarter&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are you showing off at the booth today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing hands-on tutorials at noon and 2PM. The noon sessions is meant
    to be a bit more of a &quot;first experience&quot; and the 2PM sessions are intended
    for spending some hands-on time working on more advanced design challenges
    you might have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are showing off some of the real-time capabilities of the BeagleBone Black
    by demonstrating a 3D printer that is running Linux at the same time as
    providing real-time path-planning and stepper motor pulses. These capabilities
    are unique to the BeagleBone Black in this product space. The combination of
    Linux and real-time capabilities are also being shown off with the BeagleLogic
    logic analyzer, entirely done with software running off the off-the-shelf
    BeagleBone Black and open source software. BeagleLogic supports 14 channels
    at 100 megasamples per second and will analyze over 30 protocols.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where can you buy BeagleBone Black?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeagleBone Black is sold through a number of popular on-line distributors and
    brick-and-mortar retailers. For on-line distributors, see:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/black&quot;&gt;http://beagleboard.org/black&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the relationship between BeagleBoard.org and Texas
Instruments, and why is TI at the BeagleBoard.org booth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the relationship between BeagleBoard.org and Element14, and
why is Element14 at the BeagleBoard.org booth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How is BeagleBoard.org and BeagleBoard.org products like BeagleBone
Black different than Raspberry Pi or Arduino and their products?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is BeagleBoard.org really open?
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We try to be part of the solution and not the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is next for BeagleBoard.org?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When is BeagleBoard-X15 going to release?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does BeagleBone Black support WiFi?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does BeagleBone Black support video?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do the give-aways work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the rules for display of demos?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Business cards and flyers should be placed X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
