        &lt;h1&gt;BeagleBone Black project spotlight:&lt;br&gt;Robotics Cape by Strawson Design&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;
            Inspiration is not an easy thing to come by, and no one can predict 
            when it will strike. The light bulb suddenly flashes on overhead, 
            and the gears inside your brain start to turn. The excitement of 
            the “Ah hah!” moment is great, but often short lived when the 
            realization of the logistics come into play.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Engineers often find themselves in this situation when a new idea 
            for a robot pops into their head, but then there is the complicated 
            process of crafting the internal hardware and writing the software 
            to actually make it work. James Strawson, PhD student at the 
            University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and founder of Strawson 
            Design, grew tired of having to create new circuits for every new 
            robot that he worked on, so he unified his current and future 
            robotics projects under one hardware and software platform, thus 
            creating the Robotics Cape.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
           The Robotics Cape works with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black&quot;&gt;
           BeagleBone Black&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a TI &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/pro-arm-bborgblog-e2e-lp&quot;&gt;
           Sitara processor&lt;/a&gt;, to make a mobile robotics platform. It includes 
           2-cell lithium battery charging, protection and monitoring circuitry
           to make sure the robot is always charged and ready to play with. 
           The Robotics Cape also provides plug-and-play connectors to easily 
           interface with common components so you can build your robot without 
           soldering or messy wiring. It was obvious for James to choose 
           BeagleBone Black when picking a Linux development board. Strawson 
           said, “First and foremost, robotics projects typically require the 
           control board to interface with custom circuitry. BeagleBone Black 
           provides an enormous array of hardware interface pins for functions 
           such as GPIO, PWM, eQEP, I2C, etc., which is exactly what tinkerers 
           and prototypers need. BeagleBone Black is also a fantastically neat 
           and tidy package that is ideal for tiny robots.” 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  
       When creating the cape, Strawson picked the features he felt would apply 
       to the largest number of applications. The cape offers: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        •    9-axis IMU: Accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer&lt;br&gt;
        •	6 PWM connectors to power servos or brushless ESCs&lt;br&gt;
        •	Power your BeagleBone with 5V 2A switching voltage regulator from 
        12v input or battery pack&lt;br&gt;
         •	2 user-accessible buttons and 2 LEDs to test GPIO functionality 
         and to test PRU GPIO&lt;br&gt;
        •	2-cell lithium cell balancer and overvoltage protector&lt;br&gt;
        •	H-bridges to drive 6 DC motors (each 1.2A continuous, 3.2A peak)&lt;br&gt;
        •	Plug-and-play connection supported:&lt;br&gt;
            o	I2C, UART, SPI&lt;br&gt;
            o	Range/gesture sensors&lt;br&gt;
            o	Serial GPS module&lt;br&gt;
            o	Spektrum™ RC receiver&lt;br&gt;
            o	Quadrature encoder inputs
           &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;
            Strawson first used the Robotics Cape to teach a senior embedded 
            controls course at UCSD. Each student built their own BeagleMIP 
            balancing robot based on the cape and was taught to design and 
            implement a discrete-time controller to make the robot balance 
            upright and drive. Texas Instruments’ University Program donated 
            BeagleBone Black computers to UCSD to enable such a wonderful 
            project. “We learned a lot about implementing dynamic control 
            systems in a Linux environment. I was pleased to teach fellow 
            mechanical engineers how to dive into the world of embedded 
            programming and circuit design,” Strawson said.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Strawson is working on a few refinements on the board layout and 
            connectivity before bringing the Robotics Cape to market. He also 
            looks forward to spending more time developing control systems with 
            BeagleBone Black. He is testing a quadrotor controller based on the 
            BeagleBone Black as well as a Robotics Cape Combination designed to 
            be cheap and easy to repair while offering the networking 
            capability and processing power of BeagleBone Black.
