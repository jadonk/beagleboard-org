&lt;h1 style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #b4a279;&quot;&gt;BeagleBone Black project spotlight:&lt;br /&gt;Facebook &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; Counter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;By Tara Stratton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s something we are sure you will &amp;lsquo;Like.&amp;rsquo; While at Maker Faire Bay Area this year, we gave away a few BeagleBone Black open-source computers to some lucky faire attendees. We heard back from one of the winners, Christopher Berg, about a creative but functional project he&amp;rsquo;s created on the board over the past few months that would make Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg quite proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Christopher made a Facebook &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; Counter for his wife&amp;mdash;an author who was in the middle of writing her first romance novel and was interested in tracking the number of &amp;lsquo;Likes&amp;rsquo; on her Facebook page. His device gives his wife a readout of Facebook Likes that is easily readable and constantly updating. According to Christopher, many of his projects are inspired by his family&amp;mdash;his kids have been the beneficiaries of many of his projects. (Cool side note&amp;mdash;check out the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #de7224; text-decoration: none;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/Childs-Quorra-Tron-Costume/&quot;&gt;Quorra from Tron costume&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;he made his daughter for Halloween!)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/LT9NDkB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;272&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The Facebook Like Counter uses the JSON interface provided by Facebook to count the number of Likes for a page. Once it reads the value, the counter updates the display using a simple bit-bang SPI interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s currently a really simple setup, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning on expanding it to provide more metrics, including books sold, Twitter followers, etc.,&amp;rdquo; said Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The part count for the project is really low. Christopher used the BeagleBone Black open-source computer (of course) as well as some jumper wires and a four-digit, seven-segment display that he found on eBay through some friends at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #de7224; text-decoration: none;&quot; href=&quot;http://forum.43oh.com/topic/2583-spi-4-digit-7-segment-displays/&quot;&gt;43oh.com&lt;/a&gt;. The display uses a PT6961 driver from Oasis. Christopher noted the display is &amp;ldquo;dead-easy to control and has a low pin-count. A few simple SPI commands and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;But why BeagleBone Black? Christopher said he had his eye on BeagleBone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;When the new version came out, including a price drop &amp;mdash; I had to have one,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;After years of experience developing projects such as an electronic etch-a-sketch, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg;-controlled RC car and even a retro VFD tube clock on several of TI&amp;rsquo;s development boards, including his favorite MSP430&amp;trade; Value Line LaunchPad as well as the Tiva&amp;trade; C Series LaunchPad and MSP430FR5739 FRAM Experimenter Board, he felt comfortable picking up the TI Sitara&amp;trade; AM335x processor-based BeagleBone Black computer. In addition, the Ethernet on BeagleBone Black came in handy for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you need a network-enabled board, there&amp;rsquo;s really no easier way to go,&amp;rdquo; Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;With several years of experience developing on TI&amp;rsquo;s microcontroller- based LaunchPads, Christopher admitted that he faced a challenge with this project since he knew almost nothing about Linux. However, he said that the &amp;Aring;ngstr&amp;ouml;m distribution that comes loaded on BeagleBone Black helped him get the project going without having too much to learn. He used the Cloud9 IDE that comes pre-installed and was able to use JavaScript&amp;mdash;something he&amp;rsquo;s already familiar with since he is a Web developer. Once he started working with the on- board software, he was able to get the project up and running fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have absolutely no electronics training, but I&amp;rsquo;m a great example that with the right tools, almost anyone can create these types of projects,&amp;rdquo; said Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next on Christopher&amp;rsquo;s list of DIY projects? He said he&amp;rsquo;s always wanted to create a Hexapod using a BeagleBone Black and a 3D printer. Based on his track record, we can assume it will be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #525252; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;More details about Christopher&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Like Counter are available at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #de7224; text-decoration: none;&quot; href=&quot;http://forum.beaglefu.com/topic/124-facebook-like-counter-7-segment-display-and-cloud9/&quot;&gt;http://forum.beaglefu.com/topic/124-facebook-like-counter-7-segment-display-and-cloud9/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
