Class attendance for several sessions were at capacity and many of the classes were hands-on, including hands-on classes on 3D user interface creation and .  Those attendees are now able to refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/demo/esc&quot;&gt;course materials for the hands-on classes on-line&lt;/a&gt; and all the people who signed up walked away from the event with Beagle Boards in hand.  Many thanks to MontaVista, RidgeRun, Bill Gatliff, Special Computing, HY Research, Angstrom Distribution developers, and all of the others involved.  It was an amazing event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadon/3003735696/in/pool-beagleboard/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 167px; height: 111px;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/3003735696_fae838970c.jpg?v=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also had great demos on the show floor, including BSquare&apos;s wireless demo running on the OMAP35x EVM, CalSoft&apos;s Flash demo running on the Beagle Board, and the Gumstix Overo running Angstrom.  I also got my first chance to play with a DLP Pico Projector, which drew a nice crowd at the booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadon/3002900889/in/pool-beagleboard/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 167px; height: 250px;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/3002900889_7cf775f53f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, those of you who have been waiting on documentation for the power management device, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tps65950.html&quot;&gt;technical reference manual (TRM) for the TPS65950 is now available&lt;/a&gt; on-line.  This is a drop-in functionally equivalent replacement for the TWL4030 with some analog performance improvements, including to the on-chip USB PHY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot to mention that I got an article published regarding use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dspdesignline.com/211200823&quot;&gt;open source software in consumer electronics&lt;/a&gt;.  Beyond using open source software in consumer electronics, I really believe there is a future for products like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neurostechnology.com/&quot;&gt;Neuros OSD&lt;/a&gt; as people want more control and ownership over what their products can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, at the time of this writing, we are now only 10 people away from having 1,000 mailing list subscribers.  Interest is overwhelming and continuing to grow.  Thanks for making the Beagle Board such a success so far and helping to set the course of where it goes from here!
