    <body>This project will create a powerful CCTV recorder with functions presently limited to mains powered computer systems or expensive and power hungry control boxes.

The system is aimed at the remote monitoring of wildlife for survey, study and interpretational projects and the collection of evidence in wildlife crime operations.

Beagleboard is ideal for this purpose due to low power consumption and ease at which it can be fitted into a weatherproof case. The lack of affordable recording units for this type of application mean that many conservation organisations are still using VCR units or running miles of unnecessary cabling.

Once the board is set up for remote recording with motion sensing, time stamp, camera switching etc we will look at utilising mobile phone networks to allow updates via mobile phones.</body>
