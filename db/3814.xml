        &lt;h1&gt;BeagleBone Black project spotlight:&lt;br&gt;Implementing MIL-STD-1553 with three Beagles &lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By Natalie Nelms&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;
            Oh, the places you’ll go when using three &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black&quot;&gt;BeagleBone Blacks!&lt;/a&gt;
             &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;
           Maker and engineering expert Trefor Delve explored this idea by 
           developing a parallel simulation proof of concept that ran 
           on three  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/pro-arm-bborgblog-e2e-lp&quot;&gt;Sitara-processor-powered&lt;/a&gt; BeagleBone Blacks in order to implement a MIL-STD-1553 bus system and interface to real and virtual hardware.
             &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;
           “There is always a need during a development to be able to scale performance 
           as computational needs increase,” Delve explained as he discussed the 
           inspiration behind the project. “This raises its own issues in terms of 
           how to provide that capability. Add to that the problem that often real 
           world I/O is required and the problem becomes multi-dimensional: 
           performance issues, problem description and hardware management. A 
           cost effective means to implement a proof of concept was required.”
           &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;           
           &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/qJkGpNA.jpg&quot; HEIGHT=307 WIDTH=409&gt;
           &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;
            Traditionally, MIL-STD-1553 is identified as a military standard 
            published by the U.S. Department of Defense that defines the mechanical, 
            electrical and functional aspects of a serial data bus. This particular 
            piece of technology has been in existence since 1973, but multiple
            revisions have been made to it over time and it has become the most
            predominantly used networking standard for both military and civil avionics.   
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            The fact that this piece of hardware is so dynamic is what 
            enabled Delve to further explore its capabilities and design 
            his proof of concept. The MIL-STD-1553 and BeagleBone Black
            combo certainly makes for an interesting project with its rich
            history and durable design. 
          &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
          When asked why Delve integrated three BeagleBone Blacks
          into this type of bus system as opposed to other platforms, he 
          detailed that, “a full development on PC-based hardware can be an
          expensive proposition – especially in a proof of concept environment. 
          The BeagleBone Black contained the basic hardware required: multichannel
          ADC (analog to digital converter), PWM (pulse width modulated) outputs
          and SPI outputs. In addition, the ability to download and compile 
          standard tools like MPICH (a high performance message passing interface)
          and QT (a cross-platform application framework) provided an industrial-strength 
          demonstration platform. The BeagleBone Black represented a cost effective proposition.”
                      &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Fortunately for the project’s process, Delve ran into minimal issues. 
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            He expressed that “the only concerns were that the BeagleBone Blacks 
            used were early devices so there were some issues with the ADC operation
            in terms of when samples were valid. The PWM outputs had some issues
            where it was difficult to make changes to update rates. There were 
            solutions for each of these problems that worked in my situation – some
            were at the cost of capabilities that other users may have needed.” 
             &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
             &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/tTSjyau.jpg&quot; HEIGHT=307 WIDTH=409&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Delve plans on continuing his work with electrical engineering by
            applying BeagleBone Black to automotive instrumentation, making use of 
            the ADC and PWM capabilities. Stay tuned for more on that!
