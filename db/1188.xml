    <body>Our goal is to implement the control and vision for our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, a robotic submarine which navigates without any human input.  The vehicle must navigate a course which contains visual cues to help guide the robot.  
Success will involve two separate sub-projects.  First, we will implement high-level control routines.  This means combining physical readings from all of the different sensors and determining the course of action for the robot.  The robot has a variety of sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, a depth sensor, a compass, and cameras.  Interpreting all of this information and making it useful will require an implementation of Kalman Filtering, PID control, and a state-machine.  The state machine will contain high level instructions like &quot;maintain heading&quot;, and &quot;pursue object.&quot;  The second sub-project is a set of computer vision routines.  These will be implemented in OpenCV, and include segmenting objects from their surroundings, determining their orientation and distance, and distinguishing patterns.  We have determined that 3 processed images per second is sufficient for our objectives, so we expect that a beagle board will have adequate computational power.  The small size and low power consumption make them ideal for use in a closed system like a submarine.  Battery power is limited, and a beagle board will consume less than one tenth the power of our current computer.</body>
