    <body>At the foundation of Kozio&apos;s embedded design verification and production test solutions is the industry’s first special-purpose OS architected exclusively for embedded design verification and production test. VTOS™ provides a hardware test platform that includes functional tests, scripting and interactive debug.  VTOS is delivered as a binary package specific to the customer’s processor family, which can be quickly configured for your embedded hardware– porting is not required. Configured binaries can be downloaded by the bootloader (U-boot) or via JTAG. VTOS is built to span the hardware lifecycle from design, to production, to field-based power-on self-test.  VTOS Suite provides an out-of-the-box solution that can save up to 75% of test program development costs. 


Kozio has made available a 30-day free trial of its VTOS Suite for the BeagleBone. This free trial is available now, and can be downloaded directly from the Kozio website www.kozio.com/evaluateVTOS
