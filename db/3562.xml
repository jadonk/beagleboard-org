    <body>&lt;h1&gt;BeagleBone Black Project Spotlight: Shield I/O&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some unlikely combinations just seem to work: Oreos and peanut butter, Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott and now Arduino and BeagleBone Black! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e13pW4j.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shield I/O+ beside the BeagleBone Black&quot; /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;With the new Shield I/O, you can now use (almost) any Arduino shield with a BeagleBone Black. The Shield I/O, created by Andreas Behrend, adapts Arduino shields to be BeagleBone Black compatible, it doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re using 3.3V or 5V logic or up to 5V analog inputs. Precise resistor arrays divide the analog inputs and make it an option to measure up to 5V.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Shield I/O comes with dedicated level shifters for all 14 digital GPIO pins, PWM, I2C and SPI. Something interesting to note is that part of Shield I/O comes from an Atmel ATTiny that lets the user switch logic levels through software over I2C. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device uses two TXB0108 level shifters for standard I/O lines and one TXS0102 shifting the I2C bus. Shield I/O also comes in a &quot;Plus&quot; version, which features a MCP23017 that is also accessible over the I2C bus.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Andreas saw a need for Shield I/O while working with microcontrollers that had to be rebooted to switch between different programs or adapt to new settings. He wanted to give developers an option for a ready-made Arduino Shield to use with a powerful embedded device, BeagleBone Black. Shield I/O makes it possible to communicate with Arduino shields without re-flashing or rebooting the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andreas chose BeagleBone Black because of its power and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the most powerful embedded device out there with enough PWM, SPI, I²C, Timers, analog inputs, which can be muxed to fit the Arduino pin mapping including 2 PRUs to get high speed timing wherever it&apos;s needed,&quot; Behrend stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andreas is a student currently employed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.impressx.com/en-gb/home.aspx&quot;&gt;impressx media&lt;/a&gt;, who supports the Shield I/O. Additionally, Andreas has worked as a graphic designer and has run his own business. His next project is in the works and will be used in the healthcare industry - a tracker used by doctors to monitor a patient&apos;s overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as each developer creates their own projects, the Shield I/O allows its user to employ their own creativity and make their own projects, with Shield I/O as its base.&lt;/p&gt;
