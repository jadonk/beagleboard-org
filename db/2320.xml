    <body>Synergy++ is a three dimensional human interface designed to enhance human vocal expression through interactive electronic voice filtering and FM synthesis environments. The system is composed of a two-handed magnetic motion sensing controller, computer programs in ChucK and Pure Data on a BeagleBoard, two wirelessly connected wearable Arduino microcontrollers, and an audio interface that processes the recorded and live vocals of the operator based on the performer’s body motion. This system is designed for electroacoustic vocal performers who are interested in multimedia live performances and wish to explore the possibilities of using body movement to enrich musical expression.</body>
